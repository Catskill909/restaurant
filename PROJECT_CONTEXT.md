# Project Context and Development Roadmap

## Menu System Distinction
This project contains two distinct menu systems:

1. **Navigation Menu** (`index.html`)
   - Website's top navigation bar
   - Uses classes: `.main-nav`, `.nav-links`
   - Features Oswald font with modern animations
   - Location: Top of every page
   - Includes smooth hover effects and active states

2. **Restaurant Menu** (`admin.html` management)
   - Food and drink items display

- âœ… Added elegant scroll-triggered animations
- âœ… Created staggered feature reveals
- âœ… Enhanced typography using Oswald and Playfair Display fonts
- âœ… Added hover effects for feature titles

### Menu Section Responsiveness (Completed)
- Implemented responsive grid layout for menu categories and items
- Desktop view: 2 category columns with 2 items per row in each category
- Mobile view (<768px): Single category column with 2 items per row
- Optimized spacing and sizing for better visual appeal
- Reduced padding and margins for more compact layout

## Current Issues and Fixes Needed

### Menu Section
1. **Browser Compatibility Issue**
   - Problem: Menu items not displaying in Safari and Brave
   - Cause: localStorage restrictions in privacy-focused browsers
   - Current Status: Investigating simpler solutions
   - Priority: High

2. **Responsive Layout**
   - Status: âœ… Completed
   - Desktop: 2 category columns, 2 items per row
   - Mobile: 1 category column, 2 items per row
   - Compact spacing implemented

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Short-term Fix**
   - Keep current localStorage implementation
   - Add default menu items as fallback
   - Test thoroughly across browsers before any changes

2. **Future Enhancement**
   - Consider moving to hardcoded menu items in JavaScript
   - Would remove browser compatibility issues
   - Simpler to maintain for a static menu
   - Hold off until current implementation is stable

### Action Items
1. Test current implementation across:
   - Chrome
   - Firefox
   - Safari
   - Brave
2. Document any browser-specific issues
3. Add console logging for debugging
4. Consider adding a "Menu Loading" state

## Technical Implementation

### About Section Configuration
```javascript
// Animation System
{
  "about": {
    "features": {
      "type": "staggered",
      "timing": "0.3s",
      "delay": "0.1s",
      "effect": "fadeInUp"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "slide",
      "direction": "right",
      "timing": "0.8s"
    }
  }
}
```

### Layout Structure
```css
.about-section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 4rem;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Best Practices to Follow

### CSS Organization
- Use BEM naming convention
- Separate concerns:
  - `navigation.css` for nav styles (implemented with Oswald font and modern animations)
  - `restaurant-menu.css` for food/drink menu
  - `admin.css` for CMS interface

### JavaScript Architecture
- Modular design pattern
- State management system
- Event delegation
- Error boundary implementation
- Form validation helpers

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint consistency
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Performance optimization

### Security Considerations
- Input sanitization
- Content validation
- Image size limits
- CORS policies
- Rate limiting for future API

## Development Guidelines
1. Always use full terms "navigation menu" or "restaurant menu"
2. Maintain separate styling namespaces
3. Document all customizable elements
4. Include error handling
5. Add loading states
6. Implement proper validation
7. Maintain backwards compatibility
