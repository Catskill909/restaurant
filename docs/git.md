# Git Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues

### VS Code Git Integration Not Working
If git commands stop working in VS Code:
1. First try: Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) > "Developer: Reload Window"
2. If that fails: Completely restart VS Code
3. Last resort: Restart computer

### Root Causes
- Path environment variables can become corrupted during VS Code session
- Git extension state can become stale
- VS Code's git integration can lose connection to git executable

### Prevention
- Keep VS Code and Git extension updated
- Use command line git if VS Code integration fails
- Document any new git issues here

### Command Line Fallback
If VS Code git fails, use terminal:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin your-branch
```

## Current Situation
- We're trying to write a commit message in VS Code Windsurf
- The standard Git command we've used hundreds of times before isn't working
- It's always been "Git" + space + another word
- We suspect there's a path issue preventing access to Git commands

## What We Know
1. We're using standard VS Code Git integration
2. The command starts with "Git" and a space
3. This has worked hundreds of times before
4. We're on the 'develop' branch
5. Our commit message is ready:
   ```
   fix: database initialization and private mode storage

   - Fix database loading on first CMS load
   - Add proper localStorage availability detection
   - Handle private/incognito mode gracefully
   - Improve error handling for storage operations
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Restart Windsurf to potentially fix path issues
2. Try standard Git commands again
3. Look for the exact command we've used before

## Files Modified
- admin.css
- admin.js
- CHANGELOG.md
